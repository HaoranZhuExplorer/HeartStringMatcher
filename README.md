                        XXXXX, tonight I wan                             t to give you two poem                        
                   s as a present. The first one is:                  Remember when we first did meet,                   
                our hearts rejoiced and skipped a beat.          Remember our first kiss goodnight, the hu               
             g we shared that summer's night. Remember when    we walked the beach and all our dreams within             
            our reach. Remember how we used to be when I had you and you had me. Remember when we used to talk,          
          when we held hands and took long walks. Remember how we spent our days in warm sunshine and in the rai         
       n. Remember when our one desire was take a chance and ignite the fire. Remember the times that made our hea       
      rts melt and all of the passion and desire that we felt. Remember when you looked at me and saw the one you l      
     ove and need. Remember when you reached for me and knew that we were meant to be. Remember when our love was ne     
     w. Remember the day we both said, I do. Remember the journey we started together. Remember our love was always      
    forever. Remember the promise we made together, to love and to cherish and to care for each other. Remember the p    
    romise in good times and in badand to make each one happy rather than sad. Remember when you held our child and r    
    ocked the baby when I grew tired. Remember the treasured times like these when love grew into family. Remember wh    
    en the world was bright, when we would laugh and hold on tight. Remember when our hearts were broken, when times     
    were tough and words unspoken. Remember when we grieved our loss with parents gone and feeling lost. Remember whe    
    n our love endured the pains and heartaches of the world. What happened to the life we shared? What happened to a    
     love so rare? What happed to the kiss goodnight, the warm embrace, the love at night? Did it all just happen? Ho    
    w do we right the wrong? I know that in my heart your arms I do belong. Can we live our lives together just like     
     it all began,and can we hold and cherish each other and remember our love?  And the second poem is: I promise t     
      o always lift you up When you are feeling down. I promise to wipe your tears When you feel you need to cry I       
      promise to keep you smiling To show off that beautiful smile you have I promise to be your strength Whenever       
       you fall weak. I promise to be your voice, When you can't find the words I promise to be your eyes When you

           mise to be your smile. When you're frowning, I promise to always cheer you up. When you are down and

             hen you are feeling unsafe I promise to listen When you need to talk. I promise to tell you no

                  ever you are I promise to always be there I promise to never hurt you and never break                  
                     your heart. I can't promise you the world. I can't promise you the sky. I can't                     
                      promise you that we will never fight. I can't promise you that I will never c
